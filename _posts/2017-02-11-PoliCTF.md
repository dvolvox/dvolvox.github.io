title: PoliCTF - Pwnable[50] - Hanoi As A Service

As some of you know, Hanoi is a well known exercise for recursive training in prolog language (Link). The point of this challenge was the porting of the Hanoi to a cloud-based service. After you use netcat to access the service the following message is shown:

![Second]({{ site.url }}/images/PoliCTF/poli2.png){: .center-image }

We followed this steps:

* Information Gathering
* Breaking the Input
* Get the Flag


## Information Gathering


And several inputs may be thinkable:

```
[0-9]: A expectable response is shown ( * Move top disk from a to b )
[9-âˆž]: A input limitation message is shown ( Hey, this problem is too big for my poor mind... )
[a-zA-Z]: Ok! We trigger a prolog error message ( ERROR: Prolog initialisation failed: ERROR: </2: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated )
```

**Information disclosure**: We know now that is prolog based, meaning that if we can execute code it must be in prolog.

[1*(1000)a-Z]: We trigger a another error but we know how the function is being called: [Hanoi($INPUT)]poli3

## Breaking the input

![Third]({{ site.url }}/images/PoliCTF/poli3-1024x83.png){: .center-image }

The first thing to do is close the argument and see what happens:

```
ERROR: Prolog initialisation failed:

ERROR: Syntax error: Illegal start of term

ERROR: hanoi(1)

ERROR: ** here **

ERROR: ) .
```


There is no input validation or filter! (we may think that...)

Let's test it! With a single input: 1),write(1


![Forth]({{ site.url }}/images/PoliCTF/poli4.png){: .center-image }

Success! We have code injection.

Now  we need to run shell comands on the machine.

```
Input: 1), unix(shell(ls
```

% Comma is placed to add another instruction to the function scope, otherwise the code we place next is not going to run. Unix and shell are both built-in commands to run shell command (Link).

Output: Sorry, that's not implemented!

Without unix comand:

Output: What are you trying to do?!?

They are matching regex with input to find prolog functions that can run shell commands, we tried to bypass it:

```
Input: 1), unix\x28shell\x28ls
```

Output:  Nice try...

Ok, so the basic commands are block, we found another way: exec (Link):


![Fith]({{ site.url }}/images/PoliCTF/POLI5-300x239.png){: .center-image }

cOOL! We now can execute shell comands!

## Getting the flag

So we break the input and have code execution (shell commands) its a mather of time to get flag. We used the working_directory function (Link), to navigate to the machine file system, until we found it in the home dir of user haas:

Thanks for reading, if you found other solutions let me know!
